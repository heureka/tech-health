# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **Tech Health Framework Configurator** - an interactive Next.js web application for conducting Tech Health assessments based on the Heureka Tech Health Framework. The app guides teams through a structured evaluation of their technical health across 5 main areas with 21 sub-axes, providing immediate visual feedback, scoring, and actionable recommendations.

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server with Turbopack on localhost:3000
npm run build        # Production build
npm start            # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

### Testing & Validation
There are currently no automated tests in the project. Manual testing through the UI is required.

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow Architecture

This is a **client-side-only Next.js application** with no backend API. All data flows through browser local storage:

1. **Input**: User completes assessment wizard in [app/assessment/page.tsx](app/assessment/page.tsx)
2. **Storage**: Auto-saved to localStorage via [lib/utils/storage.ts](lib/utils/storage.ts) on every change
3. **Calculation**: Results computed client-side in [lib/utils/scoring-logic.ts](lib/utils/scoring-logic.ts)
4. **Output**: Results displayed in [app/results/page.tsx](app/results/page.tsx), exportable as JSON

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Single Source of Truth**: [lib/data/assessment-data.ts](lib/data/assessment-data.ts) contains the complete framework definition:
- 5 assessment areas with emojis and descriptions
- 25 sub-axes (Tech Debt: 5, Testing: 5, Observability: 5, DORA: 5, Governance: 5)
- 100 level descriptions (4 levels √ó 25 sub-axes)
- 6 Pulse Survey questions (5 numeric sliders 0-10, 1 textarea)

**Type-Safe Data Model**: [lib/types/assessment.ts](lib/types/assessment.ts) defines all TypeScript interfaces:
- `AssessmentFramework`: The complete framework structure
- `AssessmentResponse`: User's answers (teamInfo, scores, pulseScores)
- `AssessmentResults`: Computed results with maturity level and recommendations
- All types are exported and used throughout the application

**Auto-Save Pattern**: Assessment wizard uses `useEffect` hooks to automatically save to localStorage on every state change (see [app/assessment/page.tsx](app/assessment/page.tsx:58-71))

**Maturity Level Calculation**: Four-level scoring system (1-4) averaged across sub-axes:
- 1.0-1.9: üî¥ Unstable (chaotic, reactive)
- 2.0-2.9: üü† Emerging (partial discipline)
- 3.0-3.4: üü° Defined (stable processes)
- 3.5-4.0: üü¢ Optimized (data-driven, automated)

**Speed-Sustainability Compass**: Visual leadership tool showing whether the team leans toward speed or sustainability (0-100 scale):
- **Speed** (‚ö°): Ability to deliver quickly - measured by DORA delivery metrics and Testing/Automation maturity
- **Sustainability** (üõ°Ô∏è): Ability to recover and stay reliable - measured by Observability, Tech Debt, and Governance
- **Balanced Zone**: Within 10 points difference = healthy balance
- **Speed-Heavy**: High delivery speed but potential reliability challenges ‚Üí increase stability allocation
- **Sustainability-Heavy**: Over-invested in maintenance, innovation slowdown ‚Üí shift capacity to features

### View Modes

The assessment supports two view modes (toggle persisted in localStorage):
- **Wizard Mode** (default): Step-by-step progression through areas
- **Compact View**: All areas visible at once for quick overview

## Component Architecture

### Assessment Components ([components/assessment/](components/assessment/))

- `AreaAssessment.tsx`: Accordion UI for one area's 5 sub-axes with level selectors and comment fields
- `LevelSelector.tsx`: Visual card selector for maturity levels 1-4 with color coding
- `PulseSurvey.tsx`: Slider inputs (0-10) and textarea for subjective team feedback
- `CompactView.tsx`: Alternative view showing all areas simultaneously

### Results Components ([components/results/](components/results/))

- `RadarChart.tsx`: Recharts-based pentagon radar chart showing 5 area scores
- `CompassChart.tsx`: SVG-based Speed-Sustainability Compass visualization with quadrant labels
- `Recommendations.tsx`: Prioritized action items generated from low scores

### UI Components ([components/ui/](components/ui/))

Standard shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives. These are auto-generated and should not be manually edited unless necessary.

## Business Logic Details

### Scoring Algorithm ([lib/utils/scoring-logic.ts](lib/utils/scoring-logic.ts))

**Area Score Calculation**:
1. Average all sub-axis levels within an area (1-4)
2. Handle missing scores gracefully (only count completed sub-axes)
3. Overall score = weighted average of all 5 area averages

**Recommendation Generation**:
1. Identify sub-axes with scores < 3 (below "Defined" level)
2. Prioritize by level: Level 1 = high priority, Level 2 = medium
3. Add area-level recommendation if average < 2.5
4. Return top 10 recommendations sorted by priority
5. Each recommendation includes specific action and impact statement

**Pulse Survey Handling**:
- Numeric questions (0-10) are averaged for pulse score
- Textarea answers are stored but not scored
- Pulse results displayed separately from technical assessment

**Compass Position Calculation**:
1. **Speed Score** (0-100): Average of Delivery DORA + Testing/Automation areas, normalized to 0-100 scale
2. **Sustainability Score** (0-100): Average of Observability + Tech Debt + Governance areas, normalized to 0-100 scale
3. **Interpretation**:
   - Balanced: Difference ‚â§ 10 points
   - Speed-Heavy: Speed > Sustainability by > 10 points
   - Sustainability-Heavy: Sustainability > Speed by > 10 points
4. Provides actionable recommendations based on position (e.g., increase stability allocation if speed-heavy)

### Storage Layer ([lib/utils/storage.ts](lib/utils/storage.ts))

**Keys**:
- `tech-health-assessment`: Current in-progress assessment
- `tech-health-history`: Last 10 completed assessments (array)

**Functions**:
- `saveAssessment()`: Auto-save partial response
- `loadAssessment()`: Restore on page load
- `clearAssessment()`: Reset for new assessment
- `saveToHistory()`: Archive completed assessment
- `exportAssessmentAsJSON()`: Download complete data as JSON file

## Development Guidelines

### Git and Deployment Policy

**IMPORTANT**: Never push changes to the remote repository without explicit user permission. Always ask before running `git push`.

### Adding New Sub-Axes

1. Update [lib/data/assessment-data.ts](lib/data/assessment-data.ts):
   - Add sub-axis to appropriate area's `subAxes` array
   - Define all 4 levels with label, description, and example
2. Update [lib/utils/scoring-logic.ts](lib/utils/scoring-logic.ts):
   - Add action mapping in `getActionForSubAxis()`
3. No changes needed to types or components (they handle dynamic data)

### Adding New Assessment Areas

1. Update [lib/data/assessment-data.ts](lib/data/assessment-data.ts): Add new area object
2. Update [components/results/RadarChart.tsx](components/results/RadarChart.tsx): Adjust radar chart for N areas
3. Update [lib/utils/scoring-logic.ts](lib/utils/scoring-logic.ts): Add impact description for new area

### Modifying Maturity Level Thresholds

Edit `getMaturityLevel()` function in [lib/utils/scoring-logic.ts](lib/utils/scoring-logic.ts:69-74) to change score boundaries.

### UI Customization

- Colors and styling: Uses Tailwind CSS 4 with custom color scheme in maturity levels
- Level colors: Red (1) ‚Üí Orange (2) ‚Üí Yellow (3) ‚Üí Green (4)
- Charts: Recharts library for radar visualization

## Important Implementation Notes

- **No Backend**: Everything runs client-side, including calculations and storage
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage only - no cloud sync or database
- **Session Resumption**: Users can close browser and resume assessment later
- **Export Format**: JSON export includes both raw responses and calculated results
- **Framework Version**: All level descriptions are embedded in code; updating requires new deployment

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router, client-side only)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Charts**: Recharts (radar chart)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage API
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack (Next.js dev server)

## Localization Note

The README and some UI text are in Czech (ƒçe≈°tina), but code, comments, types, and variable names are in English. The application is designed for Heureka's Czech engineering teams.
