# Tech Health Framework Configurator - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for a web-based configurator application to help teams complete the Heureka Tech Health Framework self-assessment. The application will guide teams through evaluating their technical health across 5 key areas with 22 sub-axes, provide visual feedback, and generate actionable insights.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
Create an interactive, user-friendly web application that:
- Guides teams through the Tech Health self-assessment process
- Collects structured data across 5 dimensions and 22 sub-axes
- Provides immediate visual feedback and scoring
- Generates reports with actionable recommendations
- Enables progress saving and data export

### Inspiration
The [Heureka Career Journey Generator](https://heureka-career-journey-generator.vercel.app/) demonstrates the desired UX:
- Clean, table-based interface
- Dropdown/select inputs for each dimension
- Clear progression mapping
- Simple, focused interaction model

## Assessment Framework Structure

### 5 Main Assessment Areas

#### A. Tech Debt (5 sub-axes)
1. Code Quality Debt
2. Architecture / Domain Debt
3. Infrastructure Debt
4. Process / Delivery Debt
5. Knowledge Debt

#### B. Testing & Automation (5 sub-axes)
1. Unit Testing Coverage
2. Integration Testing
3. E2E Flow Coverage
4. Pipeline Reliability
5. Deployment Automation

#### C. Observability & Stability (5 sub-axes)
1. Monitoring Coverage
2. Alert Hygiene & On-Call Discipline
3. Incident Response (MTTR)
4. Logging / Tracing
5. Postmortems & Learning

#### D. Delivery Performance - DORA (5 sub-axes)
1. Deployment Frequency (DF)
2. Lead Time for Changes (LTC)
3. Change Failure Rate (CFR)
4. Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
5. Rollback Frequency

#### E. Governance & Knowledge (5 sub-axes)
1. ADR Discipline
2. Decision Traceability
3. Architecture Docs
4. Ownership Clarity
5. Transparency

### Pulse Survey (5 questions, 0-10 scale)
1. How much does tech debt slow you down?
2. How smooth is your release process?
3. Do you have time for stability / engineering work?
4. Do you feel leadership supports technical investment?
5. Are your tools / environments effective?

### Scoring Levels (1-4 for each sub-axis)

**Level 1 - Chaotic**
- Ad-hoc, manual, unpredictable
- Example: "Only one person can deploy; tests fail randomly; no docs"

**Level 2 - Emerging**
- Partial coverage or informal discipline
- Example: "Basic tests exist; manual review; occasional postmortems"

**Level 3 - Defined**
- Stable processes & metrics for critical flows
- Example: "Reliable CI; alerting in place; ADRs used for key changes"

**Level 4 - Optimized**
- Automated, measurable, continuously improved
- Example: "Pipelines self-validate; incidents auto-tracked; SLO-based capacity steering"

### Score Interpretation

| Average Score | Maturity Level | Recommended Action |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1.0 - 1.9 | Unstable, reactive | Create recovery plan; add to Tech Big Rocks |
| 2.0 - 2.9 | Emerging discipline | Prioritize automation & documentation |
| 3.0 - 3.4 | Stable baseline | Sustain & optimize critical paths |
| 3.5 - 4.0 | Optimized, data-driven | Share practices; help mentor others |

## Design Principles

### User-Centric
- **Minimize cognitive load**: One area at a time, clear progression
- **Visual clarity**: Use whitespace, clear typography, intuitive icons
- **Helpful context**: Tooltips, examples, and explanations throughout
- **Error prevention**: Validation, confirmation dialogs, auto-save

### Framework Alignment
- **No benchmarking**: Focus on trends, not comparison
- **Transparency**: Clear scoring methodology
- **Reflection over judgment**: Supportive language, growth-oriented
- **Actionable outputs**: Recommendations tied to specific improvements

### Technical Excellence
- **Performance**: Fast load times, smooth interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive on all devices
- **Progressive enhancement**: Works without JavaScript (where possible)

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Time to complete assessment (target: 20-30 minutes)
- Completion rate (target: >80%)
- Return rate for quarterly assessments

### Data Quality
- % of sub-axes with comments (target: >50%)
- Pulse survey completion (target: >90%)
- Consistency in scoring (avoid all 1s or all 4s)

### Business Impact
- # of teams using the tool
- Improvement in average scores over time
- Reduction in MTTR and CFR (from DORA metrics)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Assessment too long/complex | Low completion rates | Multi-step wizard, progress saving, clear time expectations |
| Users don't understand levels | Inconsistent scoring | Rich examples, tooltips, help text for each level |
| Data loss | User frustration | Auto-save to local storage every 30 seconds |
| Mobile usability issues | Poor user experience | Mobile-first design, extensive testing |
| Export quality poor | Limited utility | High-quality PDF template, comprehensive JSON structure |

## Timeline & Milestones

| Week | Milestone | Deliverable |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Project setup & data modeling | Working dev environment, complete data JSON |
| 2 | Core assessment flow | Functional wizard with all 22 sub-axes |
| 3 | Results dashboard | Visual charts and recommendations |
| 4 | Persistence & export | Auto-save, PDF/JSON export |
| 5 | Launch ready | Deployed app on Vercel, documentation |

## Open Questions & Decisions

- [ ] Should we use a backend database or keep it client-side only? (Decision: Start client-side, add backend in V2)
- [ ] PDF template design - who creates it? (Decision: Use simple, clean template with shadcn/ui styling)
- [ ] How to handle multiple assessments per team? (Decision: Local storage with timestamp, manual export/import for V1)
- [ ] Should we integrate with existing tools (Jira, Backstage)? (Decision: Not in MVP, plan for V2)
- [ ] Who maintains the assessment data model? (Decision: Store in JSON, allow future CMS integration)
